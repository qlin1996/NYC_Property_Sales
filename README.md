# NYC_Property_Sales
Have some cash on hand and thinking about investing in NYC real estate? Or maybe you have a property and are debating about getting rid of it? Whether you are buying or selling property, be sure to read this report before making a decision.

In this report, I analyze New York City's property sales from 2016 to 2019 for trends in property location, property demand and sale prices. The specific questions I answer are:

How has property demand and sale price fluctuated over the years?
What boroughs sold the most properties and at what price?
What neigbhorhoods sold the most properties and at what price?
What were hottest buildings in each borough and how much did they sell for?
What were the sizes of the properties sold in each borough?
Were there more newer or older properties sold?
What affects sale price? Is there a correlation between sale price and land sq ft, gross sq ft, or the year in which the property was built?

Please note the data I used in this report is from the New York City Department of Finance.
