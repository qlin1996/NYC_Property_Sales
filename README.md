# NYC_Property_Sales
Have some cash on hand and thinking about investing in NYC real estate? Or maybe you have a property and you're thinking about getting rid of it? Whether you are buying or selling property, be sure to read this report before making a decision.

In this report, I analyze New York City Department of Finance's NYC property sales of years 2016-2019 for trends in property location, property demand and sale prices. The specific questions I answer are:

*   What *boroughs* sold the most properties and at what price?
*   What *neigbhorhoods* sold the most properties and at what price?
*   What were hottest buildings? How much did each building class cost in each borough?
*   How did the distribution of property size look in each borough?
*   Were there more newer or older properties sold?
*   What affects sale price? Is there a correlation between sale price and land sq ft, gross sq feet, or the year in which the property was built?
